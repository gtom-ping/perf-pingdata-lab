# jenkins

Files needed to run a Kubernetes pod in a Jenkins environment for performance testing.

Jenkinsfile is the declarative pipeline script which sets which scripts from the [jmx-files](https://github.com/gtom-ping/jmx-files) repository to run.

Any supporting yaml files should also be in the subdirectory.
